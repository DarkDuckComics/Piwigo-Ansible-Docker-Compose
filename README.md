# Piwigo-Ansible-Docker-Compose
This code was designed to work in tandem with my Piwigo-Ansible-Playbook code. However, they are not finished and do not communicate with each other yet. Also included is the inventory.ini file for the scripts to pull info from (the remote server's ip and the ssh private key file location). This is a proof of concept for uploading code into GitHub Repositories.
